/**
 * Canonical tool surface — the single source of truth for the ebb-ai tool
 * definitions that BOTH the @ebb-ai/mcp MCP server and the @vitalini/ebb
 * OpenClaw plugin expose.
 *
 * Before this module the two hosts hand-authored their tool lists
 * independently (zod schemas in the MCP server, TypeBox schemas in the
 * OpenClaw plugin), and the two surfaces had silently diverged (audit
 * §2.2): a tool's advertised name, parameter set, requiredness, and
 * description could drift on one host without the other noticing.
 *
 * The representation here is deliberately NEUTRAL — a compact per-parameter
 * descriptor — rather than a zod or TypeBox schema, so that:
 *
 *   - @ebb-ai/core takes on no schema-library dependency (zod stays in the
 *     MCP package, TypeBox stays in the OpenClaw plugin); and
 *   - each host renders these descriptors into whatever its runtime needs
 *     (MCP → zod validators → JSON Schema; OpenClaw → TypeBox TSchema).
 *
 * The descriptors capture the UNION of what each host enforces (e.g. the
 * `hours` integer bounds, the `deadline` date-time format). Each host's
 * renderer applies the subset appropriate to its historical strictness —
 * the MCP renderer validates strictly (it `.parse()`s incoming arguments),
 * the OpenClaw renderer advertises the looser shapes it always has — so the
 * observable wire contract on each host is preserved while the surface
 * (names, parameter sets, requiredness, descriptions) is unified.
 *
 * Host applicability is first-class: `set_delivery` is OpenClaw-only, and a
 * handful of parameters are host-scoped (MCP's `dry_run` / `dispatch` /
 * `output_path` / `redact_in_receipt`; OpenClaw's `deliver` / `webhook_url`
 * / `file_path` / `file_format`; the MCP-only `model` on recommend_window).
 * Region requiredness legitimately differs per host (OpenClaw can default a
 * missing region from its config / the host timezone; the MCP server and the
 * planning-only recommend_window are intentionally explicit) — that is
 * modelled with `optionalPerHost` rather than dropped.
