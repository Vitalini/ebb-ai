/**
 * `@ebb-ai/core` is an ENVIRONMENT-PURE library.
 *
 * Motivation: the OpenClaw plugin bundles this library, and ClawHub's ClawScan
 * raises `suspicious.env_credential_access` (severity: critical) on ANY
 * ambient-environment read inside a bundle that also makes network calls —
 * even a non-secret numeric threshold. Reading env "narrowly, by name" was not
 * enough; the reads had to be gone. Beyond the scanner, it is simply the right
 * shape: a library that reaches into ambient state is untestable and surprising.
 *
 * The contract these tests pin down:
 *   1. No source file under src/ contains an ambient-environment read.
 *   2. Every credentialed entry point IGNORES the same-named environment
 *      variable and honours only its explicit argument.
 *
 * The hosts (`ebb` CLI, `@ebb-ai/mcp` server, the web dashboard) read those
 * variables at their own entry points and inject them — see
 * `packages/cli/src/env.ts` and `packages/mcp-server/src/env.ts`. The OpenClaw
 * plugin injects OpenClaw plugin-config values instead.
 *
 * DELIBERATE ASYMMETRY: the Python mirror (`packages/core-py`) is NOT
 * environment-pure and is not expected to be. It is never bundled into a
 * third-party plugin — it is used directly as its own host — so its
 * `os.environ` fallbacks stay for ergonomics.
