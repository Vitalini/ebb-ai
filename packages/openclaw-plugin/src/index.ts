/**
 * ebb-ai OpenClaw plugin — auto-defer "do it later" tasks to the cleanest
 * electricity-grid hour. Native OpenClaw tool plugin built with
 * `defineToolPlugin`, which registers the tools so they reach agent
 * sessions.
 *
 * Verify a build with `openclaw plugins inspect ebb --runtime --json` — it
 * lists every tool. Note: plain `openclaw plugins inspect ebb` reports
 * `Shape: non-capability` for tool plugins in OpenClaw 2026.5.18; that is
 * the expected label for this plugin kind, not an error.
 *
 * Scheduled provider-call tasks are executed in-process: a background loop
 * runs `Scheduler.tick`, dispatching due tasks through OpenClaw's own model
 * runtime (`api.runtime.llm.complete`, captured from a tool-call context) —
 * no separate API key required — or through the `anthropicApiKey` /
 * `openaiApiKey` plugin-config fields as a fallback.
 *
 * ── CONFIGURATION: PLUGIN CONFIG ONLY, NO ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES ────────────
 * This bundle reads ZERO environment variables. Everything — grid-feed
 * credentials, provider credentials, the carbon-budget threshold, the
 * delivery-store path, the startup opt-out — comes from OpenClaw plugin
 * config (`plugins.entries.ebb.config`), declared in `./config.ts` and
 * mirrored into `openclaw.plugin.json`. `@ebb-ai/core` is environment-pure for
 * the same reason. Each config field's description names the environment
 * variable it replaces, and the credential fields accept OpenClaw's
 * `${ENV_VAR}` secret shorthand, so a user who exports the old variables can
 * keep doing so — the GATEWAY reads them, not this plugin.
 *
 * (The `ebb` CLI and the `@ebb-ai/mcp` server are separate hosts and still
 * read those environment variables directly; their behaviour is unchanged.)
 *
 * Startup / restart behaviour (important — read before relying on the
 * "background loop"): the loop is started at module load (see
 * `bootstrapDispatcherOnStartup` below), which the manifest's
 * `activation.onStartup:true` triggers when the gateway boots. That catches
 * overdue tasks after a gateway restart WITHOUT waiting for a user to invoke
 * a tool. BUT the two things a task needs to actually *deliver* only exist
 * after the first tool call in the fresh process:
 *   - the OpenClaw runtime LLM bridge (`api.runtime.llm.complete`) — captured
 *     from a tool-call `context`, never present at boot; and
 *   - the gateway chat/config (`api.config`) used for chat/telegram delivery.
 * So at boot the dispatcher can dispatch via a direct API key
 * (`anthropicApiKey` / `openaiApiKey`, recovered from the captured gateway
 * config once available), but tasks whose only
 * viable path is the runtime bridge are SKIPPED (left `scheduled`, logged
 * once per provider) until the first tool call captures the bridge — see
 * `runDispatchTick`. This is honest about the limitation rather than failing
 * such tasks: a restart alone cannot recover bridge-only or chat-delivery
 * tasks; the first tool call in the new process does.
 *
 * Shares the SQLite ledger at ~/.ebb-ai/queue.db with the @ebb-ai/mcp MCP
 * server and the @ebb-ai/cli CLI — a task deferred in OpenClaw shows up in
 * `ebb stats` and vice versa. Tool names match the MCP server surface.
 *
 * Tools:
 *   - schedule_task       — queue a task at the cleanest hour
 *   - recommend_window    — preview the cleanest hour (read-only, no DB)
 *   - check_queue_status  — list all tasks / detail one (read-only)
 *   - cancel_task         — cancel a queued task (idempotent)
 *   - get_grid_forecast   — hourly carbon-intensity forecast (read-only, no DB)
 *   - update_deadline     — move a queued task's deadline
 *   - cancel_all          — cancel every queued/scheduled task
 *   - set_delivery        — choose how a task's result is delivered
 *   - expedite_task       — dispatch a task now, skipping the clean window
 *   - retry_task          — re-dispatch a failed task
 *
 * When a task completes, its result is delivered through the chosen modes
 * (chat / telegram / webhook / file) and is always kept in the queue too.
